Hey Matt,

Here is my assessment 3,

Just insert a text document called "input-q1a2.txt" into the "Binary Search Tree" folder.

In the text file the first line will have the number of data elements
And the second line contains all the data elements seperated by a space

Example:

8
23 12 5 8 10 21 11 17



NOTE:
If there is a space at the end of the numbers on the second line, my program will think
there is another data element and print an error.


Cheers for the fun classes Matt :)
